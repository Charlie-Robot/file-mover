# file-mover
Designed for pulling images off of SD cards that where taken over a period of time.   Allows you to search for images by date taken so you only get the ones  you took on the day you are looking for.  Can be used to search any arbitrary folder with option to search all subdirectories aas well.  While it was originally built with images in mind, I was designed to accomadate any file type, and able to parse by date created and/or date modified.
